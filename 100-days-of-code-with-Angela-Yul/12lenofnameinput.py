# Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name.
# You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.
# e.g. https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow
# Warning. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.


# print(len(input("what is your name\n")))

# name = input("what is your name? \n")
# print(len(name))

# print(len(input()))

print(len(input("What is your name? ")))

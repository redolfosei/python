# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.
# A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.
# The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice:

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print("Leap Year")
        else:
            print("Not Leap Year")
    else:
        print("Leap Year")
else:
    print("This is not a A LEap Year")

# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43
# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.


# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("{0} is and even number ".format(number))
else:
    print("{0} is an odd number ".format(number))

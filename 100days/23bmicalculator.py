# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height.
# e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
# bmi = weigth(kg) / height^2(m^2)

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
height = float(height)
weight = int(weight)

bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
print(round(bmi))

#you can also set bmi to interger so it can round it
#eg. bmi_as_int = int(bmi)
#print(bmi_as_int)
